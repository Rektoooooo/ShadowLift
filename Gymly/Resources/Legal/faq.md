## Getting Started

### How do I create my first workout split?

1. Tap **Settings** tab → **Workout Splits**
2. Tap the **+** button in the top right
3. Choose **Create Custom Split** or select a **Premium Template** (PPL, PHAT, etc.)
4. Name your split (e.g., "Push Pull Legs")
5. Add days to your split (e.g., "Push Day", "Pull Day", "Legs Day")
6. Add exercises to each day
7. Tap **Activate Split** to start tracking

### How do I log my first workout?

1. Make sure you have an active split
2. Go to the **Routine** tab
3. You'll see today's workout based on your split
4. Tap **+** on an exercise to add a set
5. Enter your weight and reps
6. Mark the set as complete by tapping the checkmark
7. Complete all sets for all exercises

### What's the difference between a Split and a Day?

- **Split**: Your overall workout program (e.g., "Push Pull Legs" 6-day split)
- **Day**: Individual workout within your split (e.g., "Push Day" with chest, shoulders, triceps)

You create a split once, and it contains multiple days that cycle through automatically.

## Syncing & Data

### How does iCloud sync work?

   - Settings → Connections → Enable iCloud Sync

2. **Signed out of iCloud**
   - iPhone Settings → [Your Name] → Sign in

- Workout sessions (duration, start/end time)
- Body weight updates

**ShadowLift reads:**
- Body weight (for charts and BMI)

### Why isn't my weight syncing from Health?

**Check these:**

## Troubleshooting

### The app is lagging during my workout. Why?

This was a known issue (the "gym lag" problem) that has been fixed in recent updates. If you're still experiencing lag:

**Try these fixes:**

1. **Update to latest version**
   - App Store → Updates → Update ShadowLift

2. **Disable iCloud sync during workouts**
   - Settings → Connections → Disable iCloud Sync
   - Re-enable after workout for WiFi

3. **Close background apps**
   - Swipe up from home screen → Close unused apps

4. **Restart your iPhone**
   - Hold power button → Slide to power off → Turn back on

5. **Check available storage**
   - iPhone Settings → General → iPhone Storage
   - Need at least 1GB free space

If lag persists, contact support@gymly.app with your iPhone model and iOS version.

### My workout streak is wrong. How do I fix it?

**Common reasons:**

1. **Rest days configured incorrectly**
   - Settings → Profile → Edit Profile → Rest Days Per Week
   - Set to your actual rest days (default: 2)

2. **Workout logged on wrong date**
   - Calendar tab → Find incorrect workout → Delete or edit date

3. **Streak calculation logic**
   - ShadowLift allows up to `1 + rest days` gap before breaking
   - Example: 2 rest days = 3 day max gap

**To manually adjust:**
Contact support@gymly.app if your streak needs correction.

### I can't find a specific exercise. What do I do?

**Search tips:**
- Try alternative names (e.g., "bench press" vs "barbell bench")
- Use muscle group filter in exercise picker
- Search by equipment type

**Exercise not in library?**
Email hello@gymly.app with the exercise name and we'll consider adding it in future updates.

**Workaround**: Use a similar exercise and add notes to specify your variation.

### The app crashed. Will I lose my workout?

**No!** ShadowLift auto-saves after every set you log.

**If app crashes during workout:**
1. Reopen ShadowLift
2. Go to Routine tab
3. Your logged sets will still be there
4. Continue where you left off

**Data is saved to device immediately** - crashes don't cause data loss.

### How do I reset my password?

ShadowLift uses **Apple Sign In** which doesn't have passwords!

Your Apple ID credentials secure your account. To change your Apple ID password:

1. iPhone Settings → [Your Name] → Password & Security
2. Tap **Change Password**
