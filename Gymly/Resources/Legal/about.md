# About ShadowLift

**Version 1.0 (Build 7)**

---

## Our Mission

ShadowLift is built by lifters, for lifters. We believe that tracking your workouts shouldn't be complicated, frustrating, or time-consuming. That's why we created a fitness app that's fast, intuitive, and designed specifically for strength training.

**Our Philosophy:**
- **Gym-First Design:** Every feature is tested in actual gym conditions, including poor cellular connections
- **Privacy by Default:** Your workout data is yours. We never sell it, and AI processing happens entirely on your device
- **Zero Bloat:** No ads, no social media integration, no unnecessary features. Just pure workout tracking
- **Performance Obsessed:** We optimize for speed because every second counts when you're between sets

## The ShadowLift Story

ShadowLift was born from frustration with existing fitness apps that lagged in the gym, required constant internet connections, and made simple tasks unnecessarily complicated.

After experiencing the "gym lag" problem firsthand - where workout apps would freeze or slow down during crucial gym sessions - our founder Sebastián Kučera decided to build something better. The result is ShadowLift: a native iOS app built entirely with Apple's frameworks, optimized for performance, and designed to work flawlessly even with poor or no internet connection.

**What Makes Us Different:**
- **100% Native:** Built with pure Swift and SwiftUI - no external dependencies
- **Offline-First:** Core functionality works perfectly without internet
- **Smart Sync:** Intelligent CloudKit synchronization that doesn't interfere with workouts
- **On-Device AI:** Workout insights generated entirely on your iPhone (iOS 18.1+)
- **Performance Tested:** Rigorously tested for 60+ minute gym sessions under real conditions
